# My-machine-learning
This repository includes the data analysis performed by me


first data set is the the boston-crime-data analysis
In this my motivation is to analyze the boston crime data posted in the Kaggle.com. 
In this analysis I mainly focused on data wrangling and training a deep neural network.
For the target I choosed the shooting column. 
The neural network was trained to model the shooting data from the given data such as crime code, date and time of the crime.
